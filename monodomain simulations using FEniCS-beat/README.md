In this folder we collect all needed files to run our monodomain simulations using [fenics-bear](https://github.com/finsberg/fenics-beat). We recomment to follow the introducation in [fenics-bear](https://github.com/finsberg/fenics-beat) using docker image and container
```
python3 SpiralWaveTP06.py
```
or 
```
python3 SpiralWaveTP06_14D.py
```
Please note that both files contains two cases, i.e. one spiral wave for a normal action potential setting and one pattern formation for an early afterdepolarization setting.
