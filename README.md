**Cardiac dynamics of the TP06 model with focus on early afterdepolarizations (EADs)**

We study a modification of the cardiac muscle cell model by Ten Tusscher and Panfilov from 2006 (TP06 model) based mainly on the following papers:
* A model for human ventricular tissue, K. H. W. J. ten Tusscher, D. Noble, P. J. Noble, and A. V. Panfilov (2004) https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00794.2003
* Alternans and spiral breakup in a human ventricular tissue model, K. H. W. J. ten Tusscher, and A. V. Panfilov (2006) https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00109.2006
* Bifurcation Analysis of a Modified Cardiac Cell Model, André H. Erhardt, and Susanne Solem (2022) https://doi.org/10.1137/21M1425359
* On complex dynamics in a Purkinje and a ventricular cardiac cell model, André H. Erhardt, and Susanne Solem (2021) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2020.105511

In this repository we collect the MATLAB files, which are needed to:
1) simulation and compare the TP06 model with our modified version,
2) to analysis the modified TP06 model by means of (numerical) bifurcation theory using Matcont.
