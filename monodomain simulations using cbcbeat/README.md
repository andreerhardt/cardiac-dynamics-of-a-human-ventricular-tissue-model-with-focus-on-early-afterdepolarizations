# Description

In this folder we collect all needed files to run our monodomain simulations using [cbcbeat](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/cbcbeat). 
```
python3 main_monodomain_TP06_epi_final.py
```
Please note that both files contains two cases, i.e. one spiral wave for a normal action potential setting and one pattern formation for an early afterdepolarization setting.
